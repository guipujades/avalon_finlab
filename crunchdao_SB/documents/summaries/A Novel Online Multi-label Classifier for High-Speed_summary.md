A Novel Online Multi‑label Classifier for High‑Speed Streaming Data Applications Rajasekar Venkatesan, Meng Joo Er, Mihika Dave, Mahardhika Pratama, Shiqian Wu Abstract – In this paper, a high ‑speed online neural network classifier based on extreme learning ma‑ chines for multi‑label classification is proposed. In multi‑label classification, each of the input data sam‑ ple belongs to one or more than one of the target labels. The traditional binary and m ulti‑class classifi‑ cation where each sample belongs to only one target class forms the subset of multi‑label classification. Multi‑label classification problems are far more complex than binary and multi‑class classification prob‑ lems, as both the number of target labels and each of the target labels corresponding to each of the input samples are to be identified. The proposed work exploits the high‑speed nature of the extreme learning machines to achieve real‑time multi‑label classification of streaming data. A new threshold‑based online sequential learning algorithm is proposed for high speed and streaming data classification of multi‑label problems. The proposed method is experimented with s ix different datasets from different application domains such as multimedia, text , and biology. The hamming loss, accuracy, training time and testing time of the proposed technique is compared with nine different state ‑of‑the‑art methods. Experimental studies shows that the proposed technique outperforms the existing multi‑ label classifiers in terms of performance and speed. Keywords: Classification, multi‑label, extreme learning machines, high speed, real‑time. 1. Introduction Classification is a problem of identifying which of the target categories a data sample belongs to. In machine learning, classification can be defined as “Given a set of training examples composed of pairs, find a function f(x) that maps each attribute vec tor xi to its associated class y i, i = 1,2,….,n, where n is the total number of training samples” (de Carvalho and Freitas 2009). This is the most common type of classification problem called single ‑label classification. In single‑label classification, each of the data sample belongs to only one of the target labels. But in real world applications, there may be several cases in which each data sample belongs to more than one target labels. This results in the need for multi‑label classification. The multi ‑label classification problems have gained much importance due to its rapidly increasing application areas. The application areas of mul ti‑label classification include but are not limited to text categorization (Gonçalves and Quaresma 2003; Joachims 1998; Luo and Zincir ‑Heywood 2005; Tikk and Biró 2003; Yu et al. 2005), bioinformatics (Elisseeff and Weston 2001; Min‑Ling and Zhi‑Hua 2005), medical diagnosis (Karali and Pirnat 1991), image/scene and video categorization (Boutell et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2003), genomics, map labeling (Zhu and Poon 1999), marketing, multimedia, emotion, music categorization, etc. In recent years, the multi ‑label classification has drawn increased research attention due to the realization of the omnipresence of multi ‑label prediction tasks in several areas (Tsoumakas et al. 2010). Due to the wide range of applications and increasing importance, several multi ‑ label classification techniques...
